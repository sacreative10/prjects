# Black Holes
Black Holes are a region of space-time where gravity has a heavy influence, where even light waves cannot ecsape

# Event Horizon
The end region of spacetime where light cannot escape from the black hole is called a event horizon. The radius from the centre of the black hole and the event horizon
is called a Schwarzchild radius. It can be calculated by the formula r = ( 2 * G * M )/C^2. Where G is the Gravitaional Constant and M is mass of the blackhole and C is the speed of light.


# Accretion Disk
The Accretion Disk a region of spacetime where matter orbits the blackhole. The Accretion Disks radius is 3 times the Schwarzchild radius. Near the middle of the radius
of the Accretion Disk, photons will start to either spiral in to the blackhole, or spirals out of the blackhole (slingshotting out)
